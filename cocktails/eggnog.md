# Eggnog

**Ingredients**  
* 12 egg yolks
* 1 lb. confectioners’ sugar
* 4 or more cups dark rum, brandy, bourbon or rye
* 2 quarts whipping cream
* 8 to 12 egg whites
* fresh nutmeg  
  
**Procedure**\
Beat the egg yolks until they are light in color. Gradually beat in the confectioners’ sugar. Add 2 cups of liquor (or combination of liquors) very slowly, beating constantly. (Note: Any of these liquors can form the basic ingredient of the nog or may be combined to taste.)  

Let the mixture stand covered for 1 hour to dispel the “eggy” taste. Add, beating constantly, 2-4 (or more) cups of liquor and the whipping cream. Refrigerate for 3 hours. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold them lightly into the other ingredients. Serve the eggnog sprinkled with fresh nutmeg.
