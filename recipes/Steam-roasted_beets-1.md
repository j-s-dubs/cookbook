This steam\-roasting method \(high heat, covered pan\) is the best; the liquid prevents the beets from drying out.Ingredients SERVINGS: 4 

4 pounds red beets, scrubbed, halved if large 

2 tablespoons olive oil 

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 

Handful of thyme, 1 sprig rosemary, and/or 2 bay leaves 

Preparation ACTIVE: 15 MIN TOTAL: 1 HR 30 MIN 

Preheat oven to 425°. Toss beets with oil in a 13x9” baking dish; season with salt and pepper. Add whatever herb you’re using and ¼ cup water. Cover pan tightly with foil \(you want steam to build up in there\) and roast beets until a paring knife slips easily through flesh, 60–75 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in covered pan, which will help loosen the skins. Rub off skins with paper towels. Do Ahead:Beets can be steamed 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.
