_Part of the process of keeping a sourdough starter alive involves discarding portions of it during each feeding. Those discards don't need to be discarded though: They can be used in recipes like these light and flavorful waffles._

That sourdough starter you have bubbling away has more uses than just for bread. With each feeding of the starter, some is discarded, but that discarded portion can be used in other recipes, like these light and delicate waffles with a rich aroma and just a touch of tanginess from the sourdough starter.

The beauty of using starter for waffles is that the starter doesn't have to be completely active to still make a nice waffle. It's used for flavor more than anything else, so a sleepy starter from the fridge or a fiercely bubbling starter on the counter, or a new starter that's not quite ready&mdah;they're all just as good. After all, the baking powder in the recipe provides most of the lift.

The flavor you end up with will depend on your starter. A really mild starter will be much less assertive in the waffles than if you've got a seriously sour starter brewing. Either way, it's a great use for excess starter.

 ### Why It Works

- Sourdough starter contributes its complex flavor to the batter.
- Measuring the ingredients by weight leads to more consistent recipe results \(though you can use the supplied volume measurements, if desired\).

 

 
- Makes 8 waffles, serving 4 to 6

 ## Ingredients

- 5 ounces all\-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal \(1 cup, spooned; 142g\)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder \(1/4 ounce; 6g\)
- 1 ounce granulated sugar \(2 tablespoons; 30g\)
- 1 teaspoon \(4g\) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
- 2 large eggs \(3 1/2 ounces; 100g\)
- 6 ounces whole milk \(3/4 cup; 170g\)
- 8 ounces sourdough starter, unfed/discard \(1 cup; 226g\) \(see note\)
- 1 1/2 ounces unsalted butter, melted \(3 tablespoons; 40g\), plus more for serving
- Maple syrup, for serving

 

 ## Directions

1. 1.
    In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt until well combined.
2. 2.
    In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, starter, and melted butter until well combined. 
3. 3.
    Add dry mixture to wet mixture and whisk until just combined. \(Depending on the thickness of the starter, you may need to adjust the batter's consistency. It should be the consistency of pancake batter. Add milk to thin it, if necessary.\) 
4. 4.
    Cook in waffle iron according to the manufacturer's directions. Serve right away with butter and maple syrup.

You can use this same recipe for pancakes. Just cook ’em on a griddle or cast iron pan.

These were really nice. They will be my go\-to recipe. It also just happens to use the same amount of starter that I pour off of my Tartine country bread starter from MSL.

These were really good. I cut the SD in half, but mine is very sour. Highly reccomended.

I’ve been making pancakes, using this recipe as a general template, for the last 18 months. Best pancake recipe I’ve ever encountered, by far.

I make two changes:

A\) I use 300g \(10.5oz\) of starter, since that’s how much I need to pour off to feed my starter. Bonus is that it makes the batter slightly wetter, which is better for pancakes anyway.

B\) I up the sugar to 4 tablespoons. I use a very coarse Turbinado, in an effort to simulate the Belgian rock sugar effect. Doesn’t really work but it tastes great anyway\!

These are delicious\! I was gifted some 11 year old sourdough and haven’t quite mastered bread yet, but these are amazing and easy\! I added cinnamon and walnuts. So yummy\! The sour flavor really comes through and compliments the sweetness of the cinnamon and syrup so well.

necro’ing these comments, but I just wanted to say thank you for this recipe template. I recently began tending a sourdough starter but use it for pancakes as often as for bread, and today, because of this recipe, I had a wonderful bonding experience with my young sibling who has Downs Syndrome, who it can be hard to bond with sometimes but has had an interest in cooking nurtured by his Special Ed class, and was enthusiatic about helping throughout the entire process of making the pancakes, and even tasted the sourdough starter along with me. We’re now enjoying the pancakes, so thanks again, Donna Currie, for this great template. The pancakes it produces are excellent.

These are great\! Made them today and I think I prefer this recipe to the King Arthur Sourdough Waffles version, especially since that one requires you to start the batter the night before.

I made these adjustments

– Only 1 Tbsp of butter instead of 3

– Kefir instead of milk \(had to add an extra Tbsp or two to get the right consistency\)

– Cut salt back a bit to 3/4 of a teaspoon.

I’d say these are my new go\-to as well.

Great recipe, easy\!\! Uses exactly the amount of discard I have. I freeze extra waffles for busy days. I added a few tsp of vanilla and a little fresh nutmeg.. for sweet breakfast waffles. For dinner waffles, I add a tbs or so of cornmeal and spices to complement whatever I’m topping them with. A total winner of a recipe\!\!

excellent waffles\! I added a tsp. of vanilla. Even my husband who doesn’t normally care for waffles over pancakes, LOVED them and said he’d even request them in the future. thanks for the recipe.

I make sourdough waffles often using a recipe calling for leaving the dough out overnight. I made this recipe because it was quick and easy and the waffles were delicious\! It’s a keeper in my sourdough recipe files.

Is it possible to use all starter and no additional flour or to mix the night before so the new flour has a chance to fermint for folks that need to eat low FODMAP?

I’m new to FODMAP and am learning about it so a young lady afflicted by it is able to eat a larger variety of food here when she visits. Thanks in advance.

recipe rating:

These are just OK, as they don’t let the sourdough flavor shine much and turn out similar to standard waffles. Our household much prefers the overnight method from Marion Cunningham \(swap the same weight of 50/50 flour/water for however much starter you have, instead of the yeast\) or the King Arthur site recipe. These both yield a much lighter and less dense waffle, with more sourdough flavor.
