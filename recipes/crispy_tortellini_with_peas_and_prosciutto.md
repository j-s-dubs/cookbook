# crispy tortellini with peas and prosciutto

`pasta` `peas` `main` `prociutto`

- **Servings:** 3, petitely or 2, hungrily

Source: Inspired by [Ideas in Food](http://blog.ideasinfood.com/ideas_in_food/2016/03/march-25-2016.html)

##### In the skillet
- 3 thin slices prosciutto \(optional\)
- 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 13\-14 ounce package frozen cheese tortellini \(about 3 cups\)
- 1/2 cup frozen peas, no need to defrost
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 clove garlic, minced 
- Pinch of hot pepper flakes
##### To finish
- 3 tablespoons crème fraîche or mascarpone
- Juice of half a lemon, zest to taste
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- Grated parmesan \(optional\)

Heat a large, deep skillet with a lid\*\* over medium\-high heat. If using, add prosciutto in a single layer and cook until curling and browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Flip over and let cook until browned on the other side. Transfer a paper towel to blot oil and cool.
Add oil to same skillet and heat it for a minute. Add frozen tortellini in a single layer and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, until they’re browned underneath. Sprinkle with frozen peas and add water to pan. Be careful; it’s going to ROARHISS wildly. Put the lid on, and let them steam for about 5 minutes but don’t go too far because if the water cooks off too quickly, you’ll want to add a splash more. At 5 minutes, all water should have cooked off. Push pasta and peas to the side. Add garlic and hot pepper flakes and stir aroind with pasta. If you find any pasta has stuck, just add a splash more water over high heat to “deglaze” them off — loosen them with a thin spatula and toss them around until they’re crisp again.
Immediately dollop on crème fraîche so it melts over the pasta. Squeeze lemon juice over and add lemon zest, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, crumble prosciutto over \(if using\), then slivers of mint and parmesan, if desired. Dig in. Give your freezer a pat on its back.

    Haha\! That is still so, so obviously the freezer of a city dweller. :\) As a dweller of the\-middle\-of\-nowhere\-in\-Montana we have not one but two 20 cubic foot freezers in addition to the one that’s half the fridge. All are so jam packed full that you couldn’t fit another slice of bread in any of them… of course, one of them does have half an elk in it… That takes up quite a bit of room.

    I laughed through this whole thing, because I tried to put a bottle of fruit brandy in my freezer the other day, and entirely failed to fit it among that piles of random frozen berries, Thin Mints, and chicken bones. And now that I need to start stocking tortellini — because this crispy tortellini business is eye\-opening — it’ll be even harder :\)

    Ha\! I love Alice’s comment.
    We grew up with a deep freeze as well. I refuse to get one because the thought of it filling up and us never reaching the bottom makes me slightly crazy. I prefer the jam\-packed tiny one.
    Love this idea – we had kebobs with tortellini on them this past weekend while camping. I think the crispy part might be fantastic for that use as well.

    Do you think this would work with the refrigerated tortellini? Or should I freeze them first?

    Also – to Mike’s comment – Yes, thin mint overload in our freezer as well.

    What an absolutely perfect weeknight meal\! I’ll definitely have to try this… maybe with some of the frozen veggies that fall out of my own freezer every time I open it\!

8. Oh wow\! I haven’t done anything with frozen tortellini except mix it with pesto and broccoli. This looks amazing\!
    Do you think it would work with asparagus? \(We’re a low\-pea household.\)

10. [Raising The Capable Student](http://www.thecapablestudent.com/)
    I have to admit that I have a freezer in my garage in addition to my fridge/freezer, but sadly no forgotten tortellini resides either. This looks worth keeping a bag or two on hand, though\!

11. Would ricotta work in place of creme fraiche? I am more likely to have that hanging around.
    And my sad freezer situation is almost\-empty cartons of ice cream. Why finish when you could just start a new one?

    Having no kids yet, I haven’t had frozen tortellini since I was a kid \(when I used to eat them frozen as a snack\). Now I remember on all the brilliance I’m missing out on.

14. I think I could sell this to Mr. Anti\-Pasta \(unfortunately he isn’t Mr. Antipasto\). And I am totally in with JustaTech’s asparagus substitution. Our freezer is too full for frozen peas right now.
    Seriously, how did you not exploit the modern miracle that is a freezer until now? But welcome to the club\!

    With three kids under five at home and absolutely zero desire to drag them all to a market before dinner I love this idea. The problem is I don’t have creme fraiche or mascarpone in the house right now. Do you think plain greek yogurt would work? Thanks\!\!

    About 6 months ago I did something like this when I discovered your tomato sauce with the onion and butter…my kids get tired of pasta and sauce. I re\-branded it as Italian won\-tons after crisping the ravioli in a pan of butter and they happily dipped and asked for more\!\!

    This is totally genius. I am definitely going to add this to next week’s menu. Do you have any suggestions for a vegetarian\-friendly alternative to the prosciutto? I’m sure the salty bite it has adds a lot to the dish, so I’m hesitant to skip it entirely.

    The fact that you can cook tortellini like potstickers is absolutely life changing for me. I love the idea of peas and prosciutto with this\! My 4\-year\-old will be a huge fan.

    Hmm. I may be part of a childless\-so\-far young couple, but my freezer is JAM PACKED because 1\) I love to cook, and 2\) I hate wasting food. Too much pasta sauce for the night’s pasta? Into the freezer with it. Brown rice takes forever to cook? Make a double batch, and stick half in the freezer. And of course, save that roasted red pepper sauce with smoked paprika, in case you need something quick and tasty to toss with some of those frozen shrimp you keep on hand, after you’ve thawed, shelled, and cooked them. Oh, and need something quick for a weeknight single\-girl dinner when the husband is away for work and you don’t want to spend forever cooking after you’ve worked out? Gotta have those veggie burgers and buns on hand. Someone brought a whole quiche to a party, it never got cut into, and no one wanted to bring it home? Into the freezer with it\!
    Now, I’m just trying to get better about actually USING the stuff I put in the freezer. Labeling helps, I find.

        Same here. I find I have a lot of bread ends for crumbs. I made a “map” that lists the contents of each section — good for “I know I had X, but where is it?” That doesn’t mean I cleared out enough this summer to make room for the ice cream canister, though .

    I always look forward to your posts, but I’ve never commented before. :\) This recipe looks great\!

    Besides our bottom of the fridge freezer, we have a full standing freezer that gets to the point where I beg my husband \(who keeps buying great deals in the meat dept. to freeze\) to please write an inventory of what is inside because I have no idea what is in there any more. Our new motto is “shop the freezer”\(meaning: no more purchases until the freezer is at least semi empty\). I don’t think even a bag of tortellini would fit in there since my husband brought home a whole ham from his mother’s house. sigh.

    Prosciutto — I promise, you will not miss it. I added it for color and texture, but for flavor, there’s so much going on \(cheesy tortellini, sweet peas, lemon, cream, mint, salt, pepper and more cheese, if you like\) that you’ll be just fine without it. That said, my favorite bacon\-less crispy swap? Fried capers. I don’t know that I’d use them here, or that you need to \(again, peas, cream, mint, lemon\) but they’re wonderfully crunchy and salty. [I talk about them here.](https://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2014/09/cauliflower-slaw/) 
    C — Whoops, now fixed.
    Favorite brand of tortellini — I don’t have one. I probably buy the Trader Joe’s “spinach” ones more often than most and will freeze them until needed; they’re pretty good. I went on a little research bender and found that someone \(Serious Eats or Cook’s Illustrated or the like\) had tested many brands and found the Servioli brand to be their favorite. If I went to the store looking for meat tortellini, I wouldn’t find it in 10 stores, but of course this was all my store had in this brand so I didn’t use it here. 
    Fridge vs. freezer — I’d go ahead and freeze any refrigerated ones or it won’t work as well here.
    Ricotta for creme fraiche — I like this in pasta dolloped on at the end. It does not melt into a creamy sauce and you should use more than 1T per bowl. [See here for how I do it](https://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/06/bowties-with-sugar-snaps-lemon-and-ricotta/).
    Using greek yogurt for creme fraiche — It’s not my favorite in warm situations or with lemon juice because it can curdle a little.
    JustaTech — Definitely. I would cut a few stalks into very thin slices on the bias when still raw, add when you’d the peas.
    Lauren — Hopefully you’re smart enough not to store them on the door, which means they always fall, which means their corners bust a little, which we forget about until we defrost them and they leak.

    This combines many things I love. And, with our own little one at home, we often have frozen tortellini in the \(also\-packed\) freezer. I might even get her to eat peas this way\! \(Maybe… she’s been picking out green things lately. Sigh.\) Thank you again for a wonderful and totally do\-able recipe. :\)

    Hey Deb,
    This is completely unrelated to this post but I figured this is as good a place as any to thank you :\)
    I started reading your blog 6 years back when my first attempt to bake a cake turned into a square so\-crunchy\-it\-can\-break\-your\-teeth mess that I actually hid it on top of the fridge before my dinner guests came over. Over the years, I started trying simple recipes from your blog and gained enough confidence to try my own variations. Really love all the details you add to your recipes and the prompt responses\! I should also add that more often than not, if I ctrl\+f a specific substitution/variation there’s at least one other person who has given it a try, the comment section is as useful as the actual recipe :\)
    This past weekend I made a quarter sheet cake and cupcakes to serve 55 guests for my daughter’s birthday party. I made way more cake than we needed because I usually overestimate the amount of food we need and expected to end up with lot of leftovers. Imagine my surprise when more than half the guests helped themselves to seconds and we had no cake left and had barely enough for the rest of the family\! I would like to sincerely thank you for all your help through these years :\) Cheers\!
    p.s: Apologize for the long comment, this was long overdue. I start typing a thank you note every time I throw a successful dinner party or brunch but the success from last weekend made me actually post the note :\)

    Also, am one of the few people that bought your cookbook because I like the way you write, I hope to actually start cooking from it before you release your second book ;\)

36. Deb\! You look great; I think this is my favorite picture of you from now on :\) what a nice gang\! That dress looks perfecto on you.
    When I opened up SK I thought, oh crap now we have to make tortellini? The weather was just starting to get better\! So I was relieved to hear that they are frozen ones, phew. My guess is that someone will ask if we can make this with homemade tortellini, haha\!
    I used to stock the freezer quite well but now I don’t bother anymore since we’ve moved to a cheaper city \+ I have more time. My always around freezer items are; homemade puff pastry, various meats \(all prepped and labeled\), your bolognese sauce, pasta, ice cubes and my ice cream maker\! Love the comment about the elk ;\)

38. Sounds yummy.
    My kids like tortellini in soup, but think frozen peas should remain frozen till they hit their mouths. \(We remain well stocked with frozen peas throughout the summer months for cool snacks.\) I may try this out on them anyway – just in case they change their minds, as my kids tend to over time.

    For ordinary Chinese potstickers I like to use chicken broth as the liquid. I lightly brown them, add the broth, cover and simmer til done, then remove the cover and raise the heat to evaporate the broth. Beautifully brown and crispy. I think I’m going to try that with tortellini, assuming I can find any that seem to say “Chinese”.

    Mmm, pan fried ravioli \(we just added pasta sauce with some ripped up basil & mozzarella\) was our favourite easy meal pre\-child. We actually used fridge ravioli & I didn’t use water, I guess ravioli cooks a bit more evenly then tortellini so maybe that’s why. I also didn’t use water when I used frozen ravioli. Also a big fan of the pan fried gnocchi, boiling is so overrated… haha. Sadly my daughter is allergic to eggs, I so hope she grows out of it so I can try your amazing\-looking iteration\! Or I need to summon up the energy to make some homemade egg\-free ravioli ;\)

     And, should this event heartbreakingly fail to pass, I shall top them with a Crispy Egg. ;\)

    Loved this\! My 18\-year\-old daughter came home from her first day as a summer landscaper, craving carbs, and just about keeled over from delight.

    I just made this. I REALLY love the “tooth” of the pasta done this way, it’s a revelation\! I only used 2 slices of proscuitto, which I thought was enough. I also served the hot pasta/peas over mustard greens and let them get melted by the heat to up the green in this recipe. It needed something…garlic? Chili flakes? Capers?

    Oh, what a great idea\! Our family goes through tons of potstickers from our local Asian markets. And now I will also be adding tortellini to our freezer\! Thanks, Deb\!\!
    And I am glad that somebody else has to open their freezer carefully. My friends make jokes about it…

    We always wish we could like tortellini…but they are always so unsatisfying\! Lots of dry dough, very little filling. We buy a bag now and then to see if maybe they have improved but they never have. Anyone else find this?\!

    Made a slight variation of your recipe tonight\! My family acted like animals.

    Delicious. Made this with what we had in the house – bacon and asparagus. Really tasty, but sadly I skipped the marscapone and used a splash of heavy cream instead with the pasta’d water. Got absorbed and didn’t make enough of a sauce. Won’t skimp on that next time. Thanks for this easy but tasty idea.

        I used Greek yoghurt as that’s what I tend to have on hand – worked beautifully \(though for me it was better dolloped on deliciously cool – not sure whether it would have worked if stirred in before serving\).

    This popped up on Facebook this morning, and I immediately knew it would be dinner tonight. 5 stars\! It was absolutely divine, and I thank you, for bringing such a quick and tasty dish into my life\! I was only able to get fresh agnolotti, not frozen tortellini, but I followed the rest of the recipe. It tasted fantastic, and but for the shape of the pasta it looked like the pictures, so I’m assuming it wasn’t much of a change to the original recipe. 
    There was a little left over, and hubby and I are wondering if it can be frozen \(if it’s not eaten [for breakfast tomorrow morning]()\)? I’m leaning towards no, but sincerely hoping yes, because if it can, I’m making a batch and freezing it as an emergency stash\!

    OK, you were totally right. I made this for dinner and it was amazing. It was much more flavorful than I thought it would be, even without the prosciutto.

    Prior to reading this, I’d had pan fried gnocchi \(or as my Bubby called them, kliskalech\) but never pan fried tortellini. I made it last night and it was a delicious quick meal. I added cherry tomatoes and chopped zucchini to the pan at the end, and I subbed sour cream and basil for the creme fraiche and mint. Topped with the prosciutto, this meal is definitely going on my make\-again list\! Thanks\!

    I like to comment on your recipes from time to time. As one of your Italian readers I find it difficult to comment on this particular recipe, especially since I live in the birthplace of tortellini. It’s actually quite funny to see other people use tortellini in a way that doesn’t involve either broth or cream and parmigiano \(the tortellino cult only accepts broth, handmade obviously\). I’m sure if I shared this with my friends they’d all be raising their fists in the air and curse, but nothing fazes me after I saw that tortellini salad one time. I could see this as a great option for pasta, though I’d skip on the peas for personal preference. I wish I could send you some of my handmade tortellini\!\!\!

    Brilliant, just brilliant. Potstickers/tortellini=basically the same thing. Why can’t my brain work in such an imaginative way?
    Made these last night, as shown with peas & prosciutto, finished with lots of lemon and parm, and they were positively swoony. I used the kind filled with Italian sweet sausage, so fennel/lemon/parm/prosciutto, what’s not to love?
    This could be highly adaptive too, maybe even salad\-type applications. Someone mentioned shaved asparagus, which would be outtasight, ditto shaved fennel.

    One word – YUMMY\! Made as directed and we gobbled it up. Don’t understand how proscuitto is optional. I know, I know. For a vegetarian option. One thing: I have a pretty large frying pan and the tortellini were really crowded. 
    This was quick and delicious.

    This was wonderful\!\!\! Don’t skip the prosciutto, it adds just the right amount of umami; the butcher department at my grocery store can slice just what I needed so I don’t get a package.

    I so badly want to love this recipe that I think I’m going to try it again. Last time the tortellini was hard but not crunchy and the creme fraiche just sunk to a pool at the bottom instead of coating the dish. It was kind of… Just okay. Super disappointed compared to the revelation I was expecting. The proscuitto was necessary on the spoon for any real flavor. Suggestions for what I did wrong would be most welcome\!\!\!

    1. **carol**
        I just made this. I scooped the tortellini onto a plate, immediately added a spoonful of the creme fraiche, and immediately tossed it together to coat the tortellini. Then I added the lemon, S & P, mint, and cheese. It melted into the tortellini just right. I did this separately for each plate rather than do the whole batch and then serve it. It just seemed “the freshest” this way. Not practical if you have too many people though. There were only 3 of us eating tonight, so it worked out.

    This is a perfect way to store tortellini or tortelloni \(I had used tortelloni and it worked really nicely\) \-in the freezer so it doesn’t go off, not to mention always having frozen peas in there\- and then straight to the pan when you’re actually ready to eat it. And gotta love the one pot aspect of the dish. Lovely meal\! I’ll be experimenting with fresh tomato, pancetta, and other fresh herbs in future.

    I usually make this “peas and prociutto” type thing with gnocchi or orichette for my “I don’t feel like cooking” dinner.
    Ever since I have figured out this whole “crispy tortellini” thing, it has taken over my life since you posted it. I eat it for lunch with shallots, sage, and pine nuts. Or plain tomato sauce. I can’t stop eating it.

    I’ve made this several times, it is such a great go to meal when you have no time/will to make a big meal. Still feels like you’re eating something out of a restaurant. I use sour cream instead of the creme fraiche/marscapone as my small town grocery store does not carry either \(sigh\). Works like a charm\! Deb, you are a lifesaver. I always come here first anytime I want to try a new recipe or when I’m planning a menu for company, I’ve never been dissapointed with a SK recipe.

        I have to agree; this is such an easy, versatile, and rather posh recipe, that can be served quickly, either after long day at work, or for guests on the weekend. I’ve used left over ricotta with a bit of lemon juice mixed through it, on top, as well.

    What?\! I had NO idea. I’m always hesitant to cook tortellini because they get mushy…now I have the answer. I’m adding tortellini to my grocery list today.

    This might also be good with burrata over the top, instead of crème fraiche.

    I made this tonight. Husband really liked it, even though I forgot to put the parmesan cheese on his. I loved all the flavors, especially the combo of mint/prosciutto/creme fraiche…I think I want to put mint in everything now\! But I didn’t love the tortellini. Maybe it’s because I’m just not a big tortellini person. \(I like it the normal way with pesto on it, but I don’t love it.\) I do love potstickers. I reckon I can make this again with some kind of short \(non\-crispy\) pasta, maybe with the peas and some broccoli and asparagus, like a pasta primavera???

    The sauce was great — fresh and simple. Sadly, I had no prosciutto — next time\!
    The crispy tortellini, though… I used fresh and may not have steamed them as long as directed \(the water evaporated — maybe I should have added more and kept them going longer\). They didn’t seem quite done, but the crispy part didn’t seem remarkable, either.

        Quick addendum — I later realized I had purchased tortelloni, not tortellini — they probably take longer to cook.

122. Hoping to make tonight. Two questions:
    1\>can you please recommend any store brands of frozen tortellini or should I go to a specialty shop?
    2\> I am finding frozen ravioli much easier than I am finding frozen tortellini. How would this recipe work with frozen ravioli, or should I keep up my search for tortellini?
    Thank you\!

    1. 1. I don’t have a favorite brand but I often keep Trader Joe’s spinach tortellini \(I think it has green flecks in the pasta\) in the freezer because the pieces are small, not too rich.
        2. I haven’t tried this with ravioli. I’m more worried that the center will not defrost fast enough but it can’t hurt to find out, just give it more time steaming.

            Thanks\! One more question. Would this fail with fresh tortellini? Or what if I froze fresh pasta first?

                No, I think it could work just fine. But if it’s not as thin as storebought — not to insult your tortellini skills\! my homemade would definitely not be — be ready to give it more time or steam as needed.

                    Sorry – by “fresh” I meant store bought refrigerated instead of frozen which seems easier to find. However I did find some frozen today and wil try to recipe tonight. Thanks again\!

    I’ve made his a couple times now, and love it – was wondering what you thought of adding a little pangrattato? I’m wondering if that little extra crunch might put it over the top – but would it be in a good way or a bad way?

        Pangrattato is never a bad idea on pasta.
