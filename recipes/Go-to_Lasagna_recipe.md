`winter` `lasagna` `italian` `meat sauce` `entree` `main`

Makes enough sauce for almost two recipes

 ## Ingredients

 
-  1 pound sweet Italian sausage 
-  0.5 lbs spicy italian sausage
-  1/2 cup minced onion \(1 large yellow onion\)
-  3 cloves garlic, crushed 
-  1 \(28 ounce\) can crushed tomatoes 
-  2 \(6 ounce\) cans tomato paste 
-  2 \(6.5 ounce\) cans canned tomato sauce
-  2 tablespoons white sugar 
-  1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves

 
-  1 teaspoon Italian seasoning 
-  1 tablespoon salt 
-  1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
-  4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley 
-  12 lasagna noodles 
-  16 ounces ricotta cheese 
-  1 egg 
-  1/2 teaspoon salt 
-  3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced 
-  3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 

 ## Directions

 
1. In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce. Season with sugar, basil, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F \(190 degrees C\).
4. To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
