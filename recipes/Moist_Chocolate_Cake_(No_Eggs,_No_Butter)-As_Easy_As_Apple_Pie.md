_A  soft, sinfully\-delicious and moist chocolate cake, which is **eggless and butterless**. Isn’t it wonderful?_

![37c3d77e-dc0d-4aff-9f85-3ec65139b03c.jpg](image/37c3d77e-dc0d-4aff-9f85-3ec65139b03c.jpg)

This **moist chocolate cake** is the easiest cake I’ve ever come across. No fuss, no mess: you make it with just a wooden spoon. Be careful not to overmix the batter, otherwise the cake will be dense and heavy.

It’s a great recipe for those with egg sensitivities, or when you crave a good cake and you open the fridge to see you forgot to get eggs. You could never tell that it’s eggless, and the best part is it stays moist even after 3 or 4 days\!

You can use this moist chocolate cake as a basic sponge cake for birthdays, anniversaries, or for any other special occasion. Fill it with whipped cream, chocolate ganache,  jam or keep it plain, with just some powered sugar sprinkled over the top.

This time I used soy milk, but I previously tried it with dairy milk, or half milk and half juice.

I hope you will enjoy it\!

            Density varies from ingredient to ingredient. 1 cup of feathers and 1 cup of stones will not weigh the same even though they have the same volume. The same with ingredients. 1 cup of water= 240 ml 1 cup flour=120 grams 1 cup sugar=200 grams

        Is this cake sturdy enough to spread frosting on? I noticed you recommended powdered sugar as a topping instead. I am allergic to eggs so I have made a bunch of eggless cakes/cupcakes, so I know that sometimes they can get crumbly or do not want to hold together.

            Hi Angela\! You can spread frosting on the cake, just make sure that the cake is cold. You can put it in the fridge for a couple of hours or prepare it the night before, wrap it in cling film and refrigerate

         I usually keep it in the fridge for 4 days. You can even freeze it \(sliced\)..no need to defrost it, just put it 30 seconds in the microwave. Let me know if you try it\!

         Yes, you can substitute the vegetable oil with coconut oil.

            Would there be anything else you can substitute the oil with? I never have these kind of oils in the kitchen. The only oil I ever have is olive oil and am also not a fan of adding vegetable, coconut oil or so to my baking.

            Applesauce can be used as a direct proportion replacement for oil in recipes. It is a good moist fat free replacement in most baking recipes.

    This cake sounds deelish… will be making it this afternoon. Wonder if I could add grated orange rind to flavour the chocolate mixture? Should I also add the juice of an orange too? If so, roughly how much?
    Have you ever tried cooking in a microwave \(replacing cake tin with a glass or micro\-proof alternative\)?
    I look forward to your response. Thank you x

        Sarah, I usually add 1 teaspoon grated orange zest and 150 ml \(2/3 cup minus 1 tablespoon\) freshly squeezed orange juice.
        In this case you will add only 300 ml \(1 1/4 cup\) of milk.
        It comes out super delicious\!
        Just remember not to over mix it\! ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    I made your cake as individual cupcakes but the mixture seemed too loose and the cakes collapsed , it was delicious though . I made it with almond meal but followed your recepie except less sugar.. What did I do wrong?

    Elena, I loooved this recipe. At first I was looking for no butter or margarine cakes and when I saw that yours didn’t have any added eggs, It definitely got my attention\! The only thing I didn’t like was the oil part because my aim was to bake something heart friendly.. so I did my research and swapped the oil for avocado puree. At first it sounded weird to me but I gave it a chance, such as I gave it to your recipe. The result was amazing\! You don’t even get to notice the avocado’s flavor. God, I wish I could sent you the photos, the taste was unbelievable, so moist and so deliciuos. My dad got fascinated with it and didn’t believed me when I told him it was made with avocado and no eggs or butter. Next time I’m trying this with fewer sugar or sugar substitutes \(specially, natural ones\) to make it even healthier. Thank you so much for sharing and don’t doubt to give the avocado a try\!

    I am so happy to have found this recipe. Vegan, simple and very few ingredients and not a lot of oil. I just made this for my husband’s birthday with a few tweaks and it was a success. I doubled the recipe to make a 2\-layer cake with jam in the middle, but I only used 300gr of sugar instead of 400. I used flax milk and added the zest of an orange. I covered it with a mascarpone frosting \(yum\!\). This is now my go\-to recipe.

    I was in a pinch this weekend to make a cake and I had run out of eggs, but this recipe saved the day\!
    I think I may have over\-mixed a bit, as it made a large dome on the top, but the dome came down as it cooled and it worked out perfectly\! Thank you\!

        Hi Shilpa\! You can substitute the cocoa powder with 200 grams of melted chocolate or you can make it white using 280 grams of flour. In both cases I would reduce the sugar to 160/170 grams ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    hello Elena,
    I tried your recipe and my cake didn’t gain in volume, I included all the ingredients you mentioned but I don’t know why it didn’t inflate. You think maybe I over\-mixed?
    Thanks

        Hi Andy\! That’s very strange\! It came out completely flat? Maybe the pan was too big? You used baking powder and not baking soda, right?

            I didn’t try but I guess you can replace the oil with mashed banana. I was reading “when modifying a recipe using fruit purees use about half as much of the fruit puree as the total amount of fat called for in the recipe”.
            In the recipe there are only 3 tablespoons of oil, I don’t think it’s really worth it. But if you try…let me know how it goes ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

        Hi Dera\! You can use orange zest or almond extract…any flavoring you prefer or just omit it. My favorite one is grated orange zest ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    I’m so glad I found this\!\! I felt like having something sweet last night but there were no eggs or butter which I usually use for baking… This was the first search result on google and I chose it.
    So I had no eggs or butter, also no milk or wheat flour but I replaced milk with water and wheat flour with rye and potato flour \(half and half\) and the cake became sooo delicious. Just as good as any other cake I’ve made using eggs and butter and doesn’t leave you feeling nauseous after the first piece. Thank you so much, this has gained its place in my recipe book already.

    I tried this cake recipe as I had huge craving for chocolate cake but had no eggs or butter to make sponge or brownie…it turned out to be a huge disappointment…. I accurately measured everything and did everything by instructions….it was dense and tasted like rubber tire… it took at least 1 hour and 30 minutes to bake on 160 degrees. overall would never recommended and rather by cheap cake in a doggy corner shop. 
    can give any stars as it was that dissapointing

        Hi Ilona, I am sorry this recipe didn’t work out for you. If it was dense I think that you overmixed it….I am not sure how a rubber tire taste as I have never had the pleasure to try one ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)
        I am also surprised that it took so long to cook. Did you cook it at 160 degrees C or F? Did you preheat the oven?

    I tried this recipe, I had run out of eggs and decided to try this. It came out great, i used a teaspoon more cocoa, and my husband loved it. \(we are not vegetarians either\) good thing i used my 8×8 glass pyrex dish because its deeper. The cake came out taller than what you have pictured. about double and a half more than whats pictured, i dont know if it was the glass pan or the fact i have a gas oven. Thanks for the recipe.

    This is an amazing recipe\! I just had a reunion weekend with college friends, and their son high highly allergic to eggs. At 15 months old, it is a huge bummer because finding a good no egg cake is hard so he missed out on his birthday. I made this cake with coconut milk \(as he is lactose intolerant too\), and it was amazing\! Fantastic flavor, super easy to make, and the best part was this little boy shoving it in his face. Truly wonderful. ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

            Sorry again, once I pour in the melted chocolate to the milk mixture, the mixture quickly covered with many chocolate lumps. So I put the mixture into the microwave heat for a minutes for a smooth mixture. Should I used hot milk mix with melted chocolate? Thanks again.

            Maybe the milk was too cold. Try this way: warm the milk in a pan over medium heat and stir in the chocolate. Continue to stir until the chocolate has melted into the milk ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    I make this chocolate cake lots of time now and is very easy and really yummy.
    I’m planning to make it for my daughter bday \(she loves it\), just wondering if is sturd enough to hold some rolled icing…?\!?

        Hi Emily\! I always freeze it, it should be ok. Why don’t you make a mini cake or [muffins](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/double-chocolate-muffins-no-eggs-no-butter/) as a trial and freeze it for a week?
        Alternatively you can try the [Italian sponge cake](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/italian-sponge-cake-pan-di-spagna/) \(I can give you the chocolate version if you are interested\).

            thank you so much for the recipe. I am afraid I need a recipe with no eggs. I know cakes made with oil are very moist but I am a little worried about the no eggs part.Nonetheless, I will give this a try and keep you updated. Thank you so much once again.

            Hi Vikki\! The nutritional informations are for a slice of cake that weighs approximately 89 grams \(3.13 ounces\). Maybe for your son there is too much sugar…

        You can make your own baking powder: mix one part baking soda and two parts cream of tartar. For 4 teaspoons of baking powder, use 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, mixed in with 3 teaspoons of cream of tartar.

    Hi Elena, I’m trying this for my son’s 4th birthday\! Do you possibly have any suggestions for replacing the sugar? Rice syrup maybe? Maple syrup? I’m guessing they will give the cake a different texture…?

        Hi Brigitta\! Yes, the cake will have a different texture..If you want to replace it with honey, use 160 grams. Maybe it’s better that you make a small cake \(half portion\) as a trial before your son’s birthday.

        280 grams \(2 1/3 cups\) all\-purpose flour, 180 grams \(3/4 cup \+ 2 tablespoons\) granulated sugar, 35 grams \(3 tablespoons\) vegetable oil, 450 ml \(1¾ cup\+2 tablespoons\) soy milk or dairy milk, 16 grams \(4 teaspoons\) baking powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \(or any other flavoring\).

    It’s really delicious. I use chocolate ganache as my topping on it looks great. My mom said it was good, the same with my dad.
    Thanks for the recipe.

    Hi, 
    To make this cake vegan, could I add Almond milk instead of normal milk? 
    Thanks ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    Hi Elena\!\!\!
    After reading all the wonderful comments I can’t wait to try this cake ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)
    I want to bake it tonight but I don’t have any cocoa powder or chocolate\-the only thing I have is Hershey’s Chocolate Syrup. Do you think that would work?
    Thank you\!\!\!

    I was googling for no eggs chocolate cake recipe and lucky found yours .. Followed the recipe to the T by measuring with the kitchen scale. For my first attempt at chocolate cake \(in fact my first cake ever from scratch without Betty Crocker mix\) , it has turned out nicely .. Quite moist and well baked. My only question is if I can balance the cocoa flavour in the cake with something? It’s a little bitter n strong on cocoa for my family’s taste.. I used 75 gm cocoa and 200 gm castor sugar.. I don’t want to use too much sugar though in frosting it .. Maybe some whipped cream on top to balance the cocoa texture??

        Next time you can reduce the cocoa powder \(maybe to 50 grams\) and replace that amount with flour.

    Tried this cake today and it was perfect. I didn’t even have cocoa powder so I used chocolate nesquik and some chocolate syrup instead but it worked. Baked in a loaf pan because for some reason I love cake but don’t own a cake pan. Anyway thanks for the recipe.

    Your cake looks so yumm…but isn’t 4 teaspoon of baking powder way too much? I read it twice to confirm\! Even the original cookaround recipe says only 1 teaspoon. Please confirm

        It’s correct, 4 teaspoons. The original recipe says 1 sachet, 1 sachet of Italian baking powder is 16 grams ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

            I had my doubts about the 4 teaspoons of baking powder, but I listened to you and used the correct amount, and it came out perfect\! It seems like a really large amount but the cake comes out lovely with it.

    Omg my son tells me at 9 pm he signed me up for cupcakes for tomorrows class party. No eggs in the fridge this recipe is a lifesaver\!\! Probably mentioned above but short on time how long do i bake cupcakes? They are in oven.

    I made this recipe, but i did not know it was so rich\! I added mini chocolate chips to the top and made a sauce from mixed berries. Everyone thought i spent hours on it\!
    Delicious and rich i loved this recipe\!

    Hi Elena, I wish to try this recipe as it looks easy to follow, however, my struggle with cake recipes is when I need to use an alternative ingredient \(my husband does not like sugar or white flour\), would you be able to suggest an alternative ingredient to sugar that will not change the consistency of the cake? I often use banana’s, date sugar, or raw honey. 
    Looking forward to your feedback.

    I just did this cake, my daugther has intolerance with milk and eggs, I used almond milk because she is not allowed dairy or soy milk. I followed literally the recipe. The cake is for sure moist, now because I am use to eat normal cake, I didn’t like the taste that much, my daughter loves it, which is the most important, it is her birthday today and I find at least the perfect recipe for her, thank you

    I made this a couple of months ago and am going to make it again today. I meant to leave a comment then, but forgot., Now that I’m looking this up again I see I hadn’t made a comment – so, lol here it is.
     This cake turned out so fluffy and moist that I was shocked at what a good baker I’d become – THANK YOU\! My wife and daughter loved it and were proud of their new baker man of the house. We didn’t eat it all at once so we froze the leftovers in individual portions which later defrosted very well. I do like my sweets a bit sweeter, so next time I’m going to add more sugar, maybe an extra 1/4 cup to start.
     I did make 2 substitutions since we avoid the GMO wheat flour which dominates the shelves of grocery stores here in the USA.
    1. I used the same measure of organic WHITE spelt flour
    2. I used VANILLA Soy milk with the same measurement and ALSO the Vanilla which you called for since I firmly believe that there is no such thing as TOO MUCH Vanilla\!

    Hi, I’m planing on making this for my sons birthday and am wondering how well it will keep together? I want to make two rounds and cut one in half and stack both pieces on top of the full round \(making it like a dinosaur at the top of a cliff edge.\) I want something moist but won’t fall apart\! Thanks\!

        Hi Jennifer\! I don’t think it will work…this cake is very moist and soft, I am afraid it will fall apart\!
        Are you looking for a cake without eggs? If not, you can use a [chocolate sponge cake](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/chocolate-italian-sponge-cake/)

    I made this cake today, I had only 2 tsp bicarb soda so I added an egg about 1 tblspn margarine instead of oil and it turned out great, the kids and I loved it… and we ate it while it was hot.
    very easy recipe that can be played with a little to suit what ingredients you have…… no shop run cake……Thank you

    I had just 200ml soy milk, so I’ve added some water and the end of a yogurt vase. Then I added coconut flakes and put less flour and less sugar.
    The resul t is incredible, still in front of my eyes \(not for much though\)
    Cooking time for me 30 mins

        Hi Ikra\! You can make it white using 280 grams of flour \(2 1/4 cups\+ 1 tablespoon \) and omitting the cocoa powder. You can also reduce the sugar to 160/170 grams \(3/4 cup\+1 tablespoon\)

    AHHHH\! Thank you so much for this recipe. I’ve been trying lots of different eggless cake recipes the past week \(and none have really worked\) and this is the ONLY one that has come out beautifully and tasted delicious.
    I’ve been nominated to do an eggless cake for my aunts 60th birthday and was on the cusp of admitting defeat and ordering a professional eggless cake.
    Thanks again for sharing\!\!

    I’m so glad I found your recipe. I need to bake for children and some of them can’t have egg. This cake looks delicious and easy to make \(exactly what I need\!\) and you don’t have any “unusual” ingredients that are hard to find. I have everything in the pantry. I’m going to make it tomorrow. I think I’ll be using this recipe a lot.

        Hi Carina\! Sure, you can add chopped dark chocolate, it will be delicious. That’s what I did [here](https://aseasyasapplepie.com/double-chocolate-muffins-no-eggs-no-butter/)…same recipe\! ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    I love this recipe\! So easy to make and it turned out great: light, moist and not too sweet \(perfect for me\). I put in some chocolate chips and served with fresh strawberries. Delicious.

    I never ever comment anywhere but this recipe turned out so well for me I just had to say thank you\!\!\! I love this cake it was so moist and delicious. We are in a sort of broke at our house and didn’t have money to buy butter or use our eggs for my regular recipe and we really needed a pick me up. The cake turned out beautifully and so delicious we are so happy eating it. Thank you\! Great amazing recipe \!\!\!

    I made this earlier today when I had a sudden urge to bake a chocolate cake \(it’s my late mother’s birthday and she was a chocoholic\) and knew I didn’t have any eggs. Also discovered I had no oil so I used melted butter. I will definitely use oil next time. I prefer using oil in cakes. Also once I started I discovered I was out of vanilla extract but I did have coffee from this morning, so I added some coffee in place of the vanilla and with the milk, which in my case was half\-n\-half. According to my fiance, it is a chocolate cake that actually tastes like chocolate. Now I am wondering if I can double it and bake it in a bundt pan, of course, the bake time will need to be adjusted.

    Hi\!
    Just want to leave a big thank you for the great and simple recipe\!
    I had a massive late night cake craving and I thought I can try making a mug cake. But…OMG\!\! No butter and no egg\!\!\!
    I was 10 seconds away from ordering $25 dessert online from Uber eats…my husband would rather let me order $30 cake to satisfy a craving rather than upsetting me during “that time of the month” HAHAHA.
    But I also don’t want to spend $25 on a small chocolate cake so looked up recipes for cake with no butter and egg and randomly picked one. And whoa\!\!\! What a surprising\!\! It’s so easy and so quick to prepare. It tasted great and stayed moist for almost 3 days now \(we ate only about a quarter each time\). I cut down the sugar to half And it was perfect for us. We must say it tastes better than the cakes with eggs and butter\!
    This recipe is staying on fridge..Thanks again\!

    I used black forest powder as a substitute for cocoa powder and the taste, so the result it is not too sweet but light. Awesome recipe\!

    I’ve always been skeptical about vegan cakes, probably because people who baked them and offered them to me didn’t came across this recipe\!
    I tried it with coconut oil and then covered it in dark chocolate ganache and it’s to die for\!
    It’s so easy to make I can’t wait to try out new ways of flavoring it.
    Thank you\!\!

I’m planning to make this cake tomorrow for my brother and sister\-in\-law’s 10th year wedding anniversary\!\!

    Hello. I seldom make cake, but this year I want to make a birthday cake for my dad. I am glad to find your recipe, as it looks easy. I just bake it for the first time as practice tonight. My cake rises and cracks, not sure if it’s because I use a smaller cake tin \(about 6 inches\). Should I adjust the recipe and baking time for a smaller cake? 
    Also, can I replace some sugar with dice? 
    Please help and thanks in advance.

        Hi Phoebe\! For a 6\-inch pan you can use: 115 grams \(1 cup minus 1/2 tablespoon\) flour, 115 grams \(1/2 cup \+ 1 tablespoon\) sugar, 40 grams \(1/3 cup\+1 tablespoon\) unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 255 ml \(1 cup\+1 tablespoon\) milk, 1 1/2 tablespoon oil, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. 
        Baking time: check the cake after 25/30 minutes. 
        Date paste: sorry, I can’t help you with that as I have never tried it myself.
        Let me know how it goes ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    I made this cake and it turned out wonderful\! I twisted the recipe a bit by adding spices \( 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cardamom\) and I topped it with a brown sugar frosting to make it a sort of chocolate spice cake. It was extremely moist and easy to make. I also used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil and that was fine. Thanks for the recipe\!

    I made some changes to suit my work colleges food requirements.
    I used organic gluten free all purpose flour\- same measurements
    Rice malt syrup – same measurements
    Raw organic Cacao powder – same measurements
    Gluten free baking powder\- same measurements
    Organic Almond milk \-unsweetened – same measurements
    Extra virgin coconut oil\- same measurements
    I also added 3 tablespoons of Chia seeds\- soak them in the wet ingredients until they start to glue up or 20\-30 mins
    I also added about ½ hazelnuts and soaked them in the wet ingredients.
    This cake does not need a lot of stirring as its states\-
    To dress the cake I melted 300grams of Darkest cooking chocolate, add a tablespoon of Nutlex\-with olive oil and a 2 tablespoons of Almond milk. Stir until smooth
    Cake was hit\!\!

    Basically I mess up every recipe I put my hands on. But this one seemed like it had a high success rate so I gave it a try. I didn’t have anything to sift the items with. Also my baking powder was clumpy so it rose to the top of the cake at the end so I had to remove it. I used light brown sugar and coconut milk. It’s cooling right now. I hope it tastes good thanks for the recipe ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    Just made this cake, it was such chocolatey goodness. I don’t have a cake pan so I used half of all the measurements and portioned it into my 6\-cup muffin pan. Didn’t think to adjust the time so I ended up going to check after about 35mins and it was done. Loved it so.
    Gonna try to make it with honey for my nephew who can’t have sugar, fingers crossed that it works out.
    Also wondering if I can use self raising flour, exclude the baking powder and just fill the cake/muffin pans more than normal to compensate \(gluten free baking powder is hard to come by here in Nigeria\), please let me know what you think.
    Thanks again .

        Hi Luce\! I have never used self raising flour.I made a quick research and saw that self raising flour has less baking powder than what this recipe calls \(3 teaspoons instead of 4\)…but in my opinion it will still work.
        Please let me know if you try it. ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    Hi can I use normal milk instead of soy milk?
    Thanks for the recipe though.

        Sure, you can use regular milk. ![74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg](image/74540b90-149a-49ef-a92e-aae9f7adfcde.svg)

    Thank you for the recipe i’ve made this cake a few times with dairy milk and always turns out great. Tried it with almond milk and almond essence today it turned out even better, although in my opinion structure wise its easier to crumble

    I didn’t want to over mix so my batter was a little lumpy going into the over. Is this ok or shouldn’t you mixed until smooth?

    Hi I’m making the wedding cakes for my grand daughter we have celiac in family so used to doing gluten free but a couple of RSVP came back with vegan , egg allergy and dairy intolerance . I found your recipe used gf flour substitute milk with half juice half almond milk . Veg oil and half sugar . It came out delicious and I think I’ve covered every allergy even low sugar so diabetic can have a slice .can’t make it more free if I tried but definitely not taste free thank you.
