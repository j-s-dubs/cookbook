Gnudi:

    Ingredients

- 16 ounces ricotta \(about 2 cups\)
- 1 large egg, beaten to blend
- 1 large egg yolk, beaten to blend
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup finely grated Parmesan or Grana Padano plus more
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt plus more
- ½ cup all\-purpose flour plus more

      Preparation

- Mix ricotta, egg, egg yolk, pepper, ½ cup Parmesan, and ½ teaspoons salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add ½ cup flour; stir just until combined and mixture forms a ball \(mixture will be soft and moist with some bits of ricotta remaining; add more flour by the tablespoonful if it feels wet\).
- Dust a rimmed baking sheet generously with flour. Using 2 large soup spoons, shape heaping tablespoonfuls of dough into football shapes; place on baking sheet and dust with more flour \(you should have 30\).
- Cook gnudi in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and tender, 5\-6 minutes \(gnudi will quickly float to surface; continue cooking or gnudi will be gummy in the center\).
- Using a slotted spoon, divide gnudi among bowls. Top with Quick Pomodoro Sauce and more Parmesan.

Pomodoro Sauce

    Ingredients

    SERVINGS: 3 CUPS

- 1 28\-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, chopped
- ¼ teaspoon sugar
- Kosher salt

     Preparation

- Pulse tomatoes with juices in a blender to form a coarse purée. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring often, until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomato purée and sugar and season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer gently until sauce is slightly thickened, 10\-15 minutes.
- Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill, or freeze for up to 3 months.
