# Strawberry Rhubarb Hand Pies

`summer` `rhubarb` `strawberry` `pie` `dessert` `hand pie`

I turned the crust 4\-5 times before refrigerating to be sure it would come out crispy.

2oz = ~¼ cup;  5oz ½\+ cup

Chia seeds to increase viscosity of filling if needed.

Used Moscato vinegar instead of rice vinegar, just because I had it and felt it would taste nice.

# Strawberry Rhubarb Hand Pies

 
 For these portable fruit pies, Georgia\-based chef\-restaurateur [Hugh Acheson](http://hughacheson.com/) uses rice wine vinegar to make the flavors pop. He prefers it over other vinegars because it has a touch of sweetness that matches well with strawberries.

 Strawberry Rhubarb Hand Pies 
 makes 7 pies 
  2 hours, 30 minutes 
 ### For the Dough

   2 cups flour, plus more for dusting
  1 tbsp. sugar
  1 tsp. kosher salt
  16 tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
  2 tbsp. whole milk
  2 eggs
 
 ### For the Filling

   1 tbsp. unsalted butter
  5 oz. strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped
  2 oz. rhubarb, peeled and roughly chopped
  3 tbsp. sugar
  1⁄2 tbsp. rice wine vinegar
  1⁄4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
  1⁄4 tsp. lemon juice
  1 pinch kosher salt
 
 ### Instructions

   Make the dough: Whisk flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Using a dough blender, two forks, or your fingers, cut butter into flour mixture, forming pea\-size crumbles. Whisk milk and 1 egg in a separate bowl and add to flour mixture; work dough until smooth but with visible flecks of butter. \(Alternatively, pulse ingredients in a food processor.\) Flatten dough into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap; chill at least 1 hour before using.
  Make the filling: Melt butter in a 2\-qt. saucepan over medium. Cook strawberries and rhubarb until soft and jamlike, 6–8 minutes. Stir in sugar, vinegar, pepper, lemon juice, and salt; cook 3 minutes more. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and chill at least 30 minutes before using.
  Assemble and bake the pies: On a lightly floured surface, roll dough 1⁄4″ thick. Trim edges to make a 10″x12″ rectangle. Cut dough into six 4″x5″ rectangles; gather dough scraps, re\-roll, and cut one more rectangle. Place 2 tbsp. filling in center of each rectangle. Whisk remaining egg in a bowl and brush edges of rectangles; fold one short side of dough over the other, encasing the filling. Crimp edges using a fork. Transfer pies to parchment paper\-lined baking sheets and chill 20 minutes. Beat remaining egg; cover and chill.
  Heat oven to 400°. Using a fork, prick tops of pies; brush tops with the remaining beaten egg. Bake pies until golden, about 20 minutes; let cool slightly before serving.
