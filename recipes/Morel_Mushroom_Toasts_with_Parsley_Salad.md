“Any mushrooms will work\!”

3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon extra\-virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 medium shallot, minced

1 fresh bay leaf

½ pound morels, cleaned, trimmed and sliced into ¼\-inch\-thick rounds

½ cup crème fraîche

1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

1 teaspoon lemon zest

Salt and black pepper, to taste

1 cup loosely packed flat\-leaf parsley leaves

2 teaspoons chopped chives

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 clove garlic, halved

8 small slices of whole wheat sourdough, toasted

Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the bay leaf and morels and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender, about 8 minutes. Add the crème fraîche and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have melded together, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the thyme and lemon zest and remove the skillet from heat. Season the mushroom mixture with salt and pepper.

In a small mixing bowl, combine the parsley, chives, lemon juice, red pepper flakes and remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Toss lightly.

To serve, scrape the garlic clove on the warm toasts to scent them. Spoon the mushroom mixture over the toasts and top with parsley salad. Serve.
