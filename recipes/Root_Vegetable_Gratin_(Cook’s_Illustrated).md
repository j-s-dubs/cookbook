1.5 tsp Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons all purpose flower

salt and pepper

2/3 cup dry white wine

½ cup heavy cream

½ onion chopped fine

1.25 tsp minced fresh thyme

1 garlic clove, minced

2 pounds large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/8in thick

Add wine, cream, and remaining 1.5 cups water, whisk to combine. Combine onion, thyme, garlic, and ¼ tsp pepper in second bowl.

Arrange celery root and rutabaga slices in even layer over onions. Spring removing onion mixture over celery root and rutabaga. Layer remaining potatoes over onions. Slowly pour water mixture over vegetables. Using rubber spatula, gently press down on vegetables to create even, compact layer. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 50 min. Remove foil and continue to bake until knife inserted into center of gratin meets no resistance, 20\-25 min longer.
