# Nectarine crumble

`dessert` `Stone Fruit` `crumble` `nectarine`

Made this recipe with 2 nectarines. Subbed 1/3 cup oats for 1/3 cup flour \(\+ 2/3 cup flour\) and added half a teaspoon cinnamon. Skipped the cornstarch and only used 1/3 cup sugar for the filling. Used melted butter and just blended into topping with fingertips. Cooked at 350 for 35 min. Way better than cobbler, new fav stone fruit dessertÂ
