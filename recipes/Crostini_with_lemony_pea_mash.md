`crostini` `peas` `preserved lemon` `hors d'oeuvres`

Ingredients  

1 garlic clove, quartered 

¼ cup fresh flat\-leaf parsley leaves 

3 tablespoons extra\-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for toast

Kosher salt 2 cups shelled fresh peas \(from about 2 pounds pods\) or frozen peas, thawed 

2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives 

1 tablespoon finely chopped preserved lemon peel \(from ½ preserved lemon\), divided 

1 tablespoon \(or more\) fresh lemon juice 

¼ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or crushed red pepperflakes plus more for serving

 Freshly ground black pepper 

12 slices country\-style bread or ciabatta, toasted

\(this is pretty easily halved, def don’t skip the herbs if possible\)

Preparation 

Combine garlic, parsley, 1 tablespoon oil, a pinch of salt, and ½ cup water in a small saucepan. Add peas and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until peas are tender, about 5 minutes for fresh peas, about 2 minutes for frozen. Drain, reserving cooking liquid. Transfer pea mixture to a food processor; pulse until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a medium bowl; mix in chives, ½ tablespoon preserved lemon peel, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, ¼ tsp. Aleppo pepper, and 2 tablespoons oil. Stir in reserved cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls until mixture is still thick but spreadable. Season pea mash with salt, black pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired. Drizzle toast with oil; top with pea mash, sprinkle with remaining ½ tablespoon preserved lemon peel and more Aleppo pepper, and drizzle with more oil. Do Ahead: Pea mash can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
