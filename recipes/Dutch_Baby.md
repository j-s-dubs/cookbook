# Dutch Baby

`breakfast` `starter` `pancake` `sourdough`

Sourdough starter dutch baby recipe.  Tried 4 egg recipe, too much for two people.  Should try 3 eggs next time.

Use a shallow pan, not more than 3 inches deep.  Examples: pie pans, iron skillets, ovenproof fry pans, baking dishes, or paella style pans.  The deeper the batter, the longer it takes to cook; and the more moist and custard\-like the pancake.  Thinner levels of batter can be just as tasty, but cooking them too long results in drier pancakes.

**Pan Sizes:**

Allow two eggs per serving.  To cook specific serving amounts, use pans of the following diameters:

1 small serving \(1 egg\) = 4 inch pan

1 average serving \(2 eggs\) = 6 inch pan

2 to 3 servings \(4 to 6 eggs\) = 9 to 10 inch pan

3 to 4 servings \(6 to 8 eggs\) = 10 to 12 inch pan

5 to 6 servings \(10 to 12 eggs\) = 14 to 16 inch pan

A number of formulas exist for making Dutch Babies, depending on the size of the pan and the number of mouths you’re feeding.  Regardless of the size baby, the ratio of eggs to other ingredients is always the same.

**Recipe Per Egg:**

1 tablespoon butter

1 egg

1/3 cup sourdough starter

1/8 teaspoon salt

1\-Tablespoon of cream, ½ & ½, or milk \[Optional\]

**To Cook a Dutch Baby:**

Heat the oven to 425 degrees.  Prepare the batter while the oven heats.  Using a whisk or blender, combine the egg, starter, salt, and cream or milk if you use it, until thoroughly mixed and the batter is smooth.

\(Tip: you can also substitute a spoonful or so of yogurt for some of the milk, to get a tangier flavor.\)

Cut the butter into even chunks \(1 tablespoon size or less\) so it melts evenly.  Place the butter in the appropriately sized pan.  Heat the pan and butter in the oven until the butter is melted and the pan hot.  For a nutty flavor, let the butter brown slightly but don’t let it burn.  Swirl the butter in the pan to coat the bottom and sides before pouring in the batter.

Pour the batter into the hot pan and return the pan to the oven \(be careful not to spill: the batter may swirl around a bit in the shallow pan as you move it\).

Bake until the pancake is puffed and golden.  Allow 12 to 15 minutes for a 4\-egg pancake.  Smaller and larger pancakes’ cooking times will vary accordingly.  If you notice one side of the pan puffing up more than the other, turn the pan around about halfway through for more even cooking.

Once out of the oven the pancake will begin to deflate.  Serve it right away, adding any toppings as desired.   Powdered sugar, squeeze of lemon, syrups, fruits, etc….
