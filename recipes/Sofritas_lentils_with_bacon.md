`main` `lentils` `sofritas` `cottage bacon` `bacon`

Ingredients:

~ 1 cup dried puy de pays lentils

1\+ cup Chicken stock

~ 1 cup sofritas: equal parts carrot, celery, shallot; roasted red pepper because it was around

2 slices bacon \(used cottage bacon because I had it\)

Handful of wilting greens \(used dandelion greens because I had them\)

1 tbs vinegar \(red wine?\)

1 tbs dijon mustard

3 tbs olive oil

The greens of one scallion, sliced

Salt/pepper to tast

Method:

Bring lentils to a boil with enough stock to cover \+ 1 inch, then reduce to a simmer and cook until done/toothsome

Cook bacon in large skillet on medium heat until almost done, then reduce heat and add sofritas.  Cook until all vegetables are soft, add salt if needed.

Add cooked lentils and greens, increase heat to high and cook until greens have wilted.  Once greens have wilted, remove lentils from heat.

Whisk together vinegar, mustard, and olive oil; add to lentils.  Top with scallions and salt/pepper to taste.

Let sit ~10 min until lentils have absorbed the dressing.
