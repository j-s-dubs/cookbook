- 3 jalapeno chilies
- 1 14.5oz can fire roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 tbs vegetable oil

Recipe

1. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add water, pork, and ½ teas salt. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring every now and then so that no one piece gets too brown on the bottom. Uncover and increase heat to medium\-high. Continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring often, to brown pork. Transfer pork to a bowl and set aside.
2. Move oven rack to lowest position and set the other to the top position. Preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with baking spray. Split and stem the Anaheim chilies. Arrange them skin side up on the baking sheet. Add the jalapenos and place on upper rack and broil until blackened and soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Flip the jalapenos halfway through cook time. When done cooking, put the peppers in a bowl and cover with foil. Let sit for 5 minutes.
3. When peppers are cook enough to handle, peel skins from Anaheim’s and place in a blander with the tomatoes. Pulse a few times until things are finely chopped. Set jalapenos aside for later.
4. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
5. Heat oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic and cumin and cook for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the flour in and cook for 1 minutes. Whisk in the broth. Add the tomato and pepper mixture. Return the pork to the pot with and accumulated juices. Bring to a simmer and scrape up any brown bits. Cover and carefully transfer pot to the oven on the lowest rack. Cook for 1 to 1 ¼ hours.
6. Keeping the skins on, stem and seed the jalapenos. Cut into small pieces and stir into chili. Season the chili with salt and cayenne pepper as needed. Serve with lime wedges and desired toppings.
