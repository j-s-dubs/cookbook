`winter` `cabbage` `Bratwurst`

1 tablespoon vegetable oilÂ 

1 1/4 pounds Bratwurst sausage links, sliced into medallionsÂ 

1 tbs butterÂ 

1 medium onion, slicedÂ 

1 Gala apple, cored and slicedÂ 

3 garlic cloves, smashedÂ 

1 1/2 poundsÂ green cabbage, slicedÂ 

1 \(12 ounce\) beerÂ 

2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauceÂ 

1 tablespoon Dijon mustardÂ 

Kosher saltÂ Freshly ground black pepperÂ Â 

2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or 2 tbs sour cream

**Step 1 Â Â Â** 

In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium high heat until hot, then brown the sausages, turning once, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausages to a platter.

**Step 2 Â Â Â** 

Melt butter. Stir in the onion, apple, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, then cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes.

**Step 3 Â Â Â** 

Place the sausage back in the pot along with the cabbage, beer, Worcestershire, and mustard, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, then cook, covered, until cabbage is tender, about 20 minutes. Uncover pot and simmer until liquid is almost evaporated, about 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with the dill or sour cream and serve.
