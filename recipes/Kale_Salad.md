**Kale Salad with Parm and Lemon**

_serves 4_

1 large bunch kale, washed and trimmed of stems

4 ounces Parm, grated

2 lemons, juiced

Roll several kale leaves lengthwise and using the point of a chef’s knife, cut away the thick center stem. Discard. Roll the remaining stack of de\-veined leaves into a tight cigar shape and slice into thin ribbons.

Toss the shaved kale with the cheese. Whisk the lemon juice and olive oil and pour over the salad. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Let the salad sit at room temperature hfor an hour before serving.
