      # Savory Corn Muffins

   ## Why This Recipe Works

 For a corn muffin with great cornmeal flavor and proper muffin structure, we used a ratio of 2 parts cornmeal to 1 part flour. We ditched the copious amount of sugar found in most recipes for a truly savory muffin. To help make up for the moisture that sugar normally provides, we used a mix of milk, butter, and sour cream for the right amount of water and fat. Finally, in order to get extra liquid into the batter, we precooked a portion of the cornmeal with additional milk to make a polenta\-like porridge. By hydrating and gelling the starch in the cornmeal, we trapped free water and produced a supermoist muffin.

   ## Instructions

 Makes 12 Muffins 
   We developed this recipe with our preferred cornmeal, Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Cornmeal. Other cornmeals will work in the recipe, but don’t use coarse\-ground or white cornmeal.

 
 **1.** Adjust oven rack to upper\-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease 12\-cup muffin tin. Whisk 1 1/2 cups cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl.

**2.** Combine milk and remaining 1/2 cup cornmeal in large bowl. Microwave milk\-cornmeal mixture for 1 1/2 minutes. Whisk thoroughly and continue to microwave, whisking every 30 seconds, until thickened to batter\-like consistency \(whisk will leave channel in bottom of bowl that slowly fills in\), 1 to 3 minutes longer. Whisk in sour cream, melted butter, and sugar until combined. Whisk in eggs until combined. Fold in flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Using portion scoop or large spoon, divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups \(about 1/2 cup batter per cup; batter will mound slightly above rim\).

**3.** Bake until tops are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 13 to 17 minutes, rotating muffin tin halfway through baking. Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove muffins from muffin tin and let cool 5 minutes longer. Serve warm.

   Can I make this a day in advance and, if so, what is the best way to serve them? Store in plastic bag? Reheat in oven?
