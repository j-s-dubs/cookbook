### **INGREDIENTS**

**3**Â **lbs. ripe pears, peeled, cored and diced**

**3 Tbsp****. honey**

**1 Tbsp****. lemon juice**

**1 tsp****. ground cinnamon**

**1/2 tsp****. ground ginger**

**1/4 tsp****. salt**

**pinch of groud nutmeg**

**pinch of ground cloves**

### 

### **INSTRUCTIONS**

Stir all ingredients together in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium\-high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for about 50 minutes, covering so that the lid is slightly open, and stirring occasionally. Keep an eye on the mixture so that the bottom does not burn. Once it has reduced slightly and thickened, remove from heat and transfer to a food processor. Pulse until smooth. \(Or you can skip this step and keep the pear butter chunky.\)

Transfer to canning jars or a heat\-proof container, seal, and refrigerate until ready to use. Keep for up to a week.

\*If your pear butter is too thin, feel free to run the mixture through a strainer to remove extra liquid. Alternately, let the mixture simmer on the stove longer to reduce more.
