INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a nonstick wok or large skillet, heat the oil. Add the onion, carrots and cabbage and stir\-fry over high heat until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the rice and stir\-fry until heated through and beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.
