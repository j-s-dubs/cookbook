### Ingredients

3 tbsp butter

1 softball sized yellow onion thinly sliced

1 small green bell pepper thinly sliced

salt

freshly ground black pepper

8 ounces baby bella mushrooms chopped

20 ounces ribeye steak thinly sliced \(I had two\)\*

8 1\-ounce slices provolone cheese

4 hoagie rolls sliced in half almost all the way through![62b3c235-0d53-41b4-baa3-b2ddd875535f.svg](image/62b3c235-0d53-41b4-baa3-b2ddd875535f.svg)

[Instructions](https://www.mediavine.com)

In a large nonstick skillet, add the butter, onion, pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Cook for 15\-20 minutes over medium heat, until soft.

Remove the peppers and onions to a bowl, turn the heat to medium high, then add the mushrooms. Cook for about 5 minutes until they are well browned.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Remove the mushrooms to the bowl with the peppers and onions, then add half the steak slices to the pan. Cook for about 30\-60 seconds on each side to just barely cook it through, then remove the steak to the bowl and cook the remaining beef. 

Turn off the heat, and add the reserved cooked onions, peppers, mushrooms, and beef to the skillet. Divide the filling into four sections, and top each section with two slices of cheese. Put a lid on, and give the cheese a minute or two to melt. 

Spoon each of the four sections into one of the four hoagie rolls, then roll each hoagie tightly in aluminum foil. 

Arrange the hoagies on a sheet pan and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Eat the cheesesteaks while they’re hot and gooey. Enjoy\!

### Notes

\*Strip steak works great too. For slicing, if you can buy the beef pre\-shaved, that will save you a lot of prep time. Sometimes I can get it that way from my [Butcherbox](https://www.butcherbox.com/fifteenspatulas/), but ask your butcher \(affiliate\). If you're slicing it yourself, freeze the steak for 30 minutes, and prep and cook the other ingredients while you wait. Freezing the steak makes slicing MUCH easier.
