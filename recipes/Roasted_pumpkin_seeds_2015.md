# Roasted pumpkin seeds 2015

`pumpkin seeds` `snack` `halloween`

Ingredients:

Seeds from two pumpkins

1 tsp salt

2 Tbs butter \(salted, Kriemhild Meadow Butter if possible\)

Extra sea salt for sprinkling

Method:

Clean seeds and then brine in solution with 1 tsp salt for ~2 hours.  Drain and let dry over night.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spread seeds in a single layer, dab with pieces of butter.  Roast for 20\-30 min until golden brown, stir several times to distribute melted butter and allow even browning.  Should be done in two batches.  Sprinkle with salt immediately when removing from oven, allow to cool on paper towels.
