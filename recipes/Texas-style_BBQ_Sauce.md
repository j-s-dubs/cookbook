# Texas-style BBQ Sauce

**Classic Barbecue Sauce**, by Aaron Franklin

Makes about 3 cups

1 3/4 cups ketchup

1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water

1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon cider vinegar

1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon white vinegar

1/4 tablespoons plus 11/2 teaspoons brown sugar

2 tablespoons plus 11/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

1 tablespoon chile powder

~~1 tablespoon ground cumin~~

1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 1/2 teaspoons coarse black pepper

Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and warm gently over medium heat, stirring occasionally. There is no need to bring the mixture to a boil, as the idea is just to warm it enough to melt and integrate the ingredients. Once you have done that, remove from the heat and let cool. Transfer to a jar, bottle, squeeze bottle, or however you want to store it. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

REDUCED IT TO MAKE IT THICKER. Maybe do it without water next time.
