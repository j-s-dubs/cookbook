Braised Leeks with Garlic and Wine

4 big leeks, well\-washed and patted dry

4 big cloves of garlic, peeled and finely sliced

6 tbsp butter 

2 wineglasses of white wine

1 cup chicken stock

Half a lemon, sliced

Sea salt and fresh ground black pepper

Trim the ragged, brown ends of the green leeks off and discard. Then cut the rest of the fresh, green part of the leeks away from the round white bulbs. Finely slice the green parts and reserve. Tear back and discard the first two layers of the white part of the leeks, leaving the tender whiter flesh. Rinse well and slice into 1 inch rounds.

In a dutch oven melt the butter over medium heat. Slowly fry the garlic in the butter with the dark green leek tops until the garlic is softened but not colored. Go slow and let the garlic infuse the butter.

Add the pieces of white leek and toss them in the flavoured butter. Add salt and pepper to taste and toss as well. Squeeze the lemon over and toss it in, then pour the wine and stock in and cover with a circle of parchment paper cut to fit in the dutch oven.

Bake in the oven at 350Â°F for 35 minutes or until tender and tasty. The butter should emulsify with the stock and wine to create a slightly shiny broth. Pour over a batch of pasta \- or eat directly from a bowl with a large spoon.
