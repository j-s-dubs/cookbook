“The mashed potatoes are easy, dear girl. Cook your taters till soft and mash

with salt \(not too much\), pepper and butter. Don’t add too much milk, just

enough to stir them up well, because then you will add sour cream, which

will make them creamier. Add parmesan, sliced green onions and bacon.

I cook a couple of strips in the microwave till they are well done so I can

crumble them up. As to the proportions of things, you just need to play with

that, depending on how many potatoes you are doing. For only two or three

potatoes, you will probably need ¾ C of sour cream and about ¼ C of

parmesan.

After they are mixed up, put them in a casserole dish and bake at 325 for

about half an hour.”
