`winter` `apple cider` `main` `sausage` `apples` `Fall`

## Note: used regular apple cider vinegar and no sage, turned out fine 

## **Ingredients**

1 \(12\-oz.\) bottle hard apple cider, divided 

1 tablespoon all\-purpose flour 

1 tablespoon olive oil 

1 1/4 pounds fresh kielbasa \(Polish sausage\)

1 yellow onion, sliced \(about 1 cup\) 

8 ounces Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1\-inch pieces 

1 teaspoon kosher salt 

1/2 teaspoon black pepper 

1 Fuji apple, sliced \(about 1 cup\) 

1 tbs whole\-grain mustard  

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage

## **How to Make It**

**Step 1**

Whisk together 1/2 cup of the cider and flour in a small bowl; set aside.

**Step 2**

Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium\-high. Add sausage, and cook, turning occasionally until all sides are browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate \(it will not be cooked through\).

**Step 3**

Add onion to skillet over medium\-high, and cook, stirring constantly, 3 minutes. Add potatoes, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring often until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add apple slices and remaining 1 cup cider, scraping bottom of skillet with a wooden spoon to release brown bits. Bring mixture to a simmer, and return sausage to skillet. Reduce heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until sausage is cooked through \(thermometer reads 150\-160\) and liquid is reduced, about 15 minutes.

**Step 4**

Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage and vegetables to a serving platter.

**Step 5**

Whisk reserved flour mixture, mustard, and sage into skillet, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Drizzle over sausage and vegetables.
