`breakfast` `eggs` `brunch` `strata`

3 large eggs

3/4 cup creme fraiche

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme or herbs de provence

Salt and pepper

2 oz cheddar cheese, shredded \(could use gruyere\)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1/2 cup chopped leeks

1 cup stale bread croutons

1\) Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees.  Whisk eggs, mil, thyme, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper together in a bowl. Stir in cheese and set aside. 

2\) Melt butter in 8\-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add leeks and cook until softened, \-7 min.  Add croutons and cook, using spatula to press into pan to absorb butter, until bread is lightly toasted, ~3 min

3\) Off heat, fold in egg mixture until slightly thickened and well combined with bread. Gently press down on bread to help absorb the egg mixture.  Bake until edges and center of strata are puffed and edges have pulled away slight from the sides ~15\-20 min.

4\) Using pot holders, remove skillet from oven, let stand for 5 min before serving.  Keep potholder over skillet handle to avoid burning hands\!
