> 
> 1 cup heavy cream
> 
> 
> 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted

> 2 tablespoons milk

> Place flour in large bowl. With a large wooden spoon, gradually stir in cream and milk to form a sticky dough. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and fold twice gently to form a ball. Do not knead. Gently pat dough to a generous 1/2” thickness. Cut with floured 2\-1/2” biscuit cutter, leaving as little dough between cuts as possible. Gather remaining dough and pat again to a generous 1/2” thickness. Should form 8 biscuits with a 2\-1/2” biscuit cutter.

Gravy

1 lb. mild or hot pork sausage

½ cup finely chopped yellow onion

8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms

1 large garlic clove, minced

3 tablespoon salted butter

¼ cup all\-purpose flour

2 c. whole milk

¼ c. sour cream

1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

¼ teaspoon rosemary

freshly ground black pepper

dash of cayenne

In a large skillet, brown sausage over medium\-high heat. Break up the sausage and let it brown it for a couple minutes, then turn heat down to medium. Continue cooking, continuing to break up the sausage into smaller pieces. When just a little pink is remaining in the sausage, stir in the onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook until the onions are transparent and the mushrooms are nicely softened, about 6 to 10 minutes.

Now slide everything in the skillet to one side. Add butter to other side of skillet. When the butter is melted, sprinkle the flour over the butter, while whisking \(a flat whisk works well here\). Draw in as much butter and sausage fat as you can, into the flour. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the mixture is bubbling and slightly brownded.

Cook for 1 minute. Then slowly add the milk while you whisk and scrape the bottom of the pan. Once this mixture is smoothed out, bring the sausage and mushroom mixture into the milk mixture. Stir to incorporate. Cook until thickened, about 15 minutes. Then stir in sour cream, thyme,  and rosemary, and season with freshly ground black pepper.

Serve over biscuits.
