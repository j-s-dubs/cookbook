\(Ingredients2\-3 lbs. of bone\-in beef short ribs 1 tablespoon of coconut oil 15 oz. can of tomato sauce ½ cup of balsamic vinegar 4 whole dried dates 6 garlic cloves, smashed\)

I had wanted to do a braised short rib that incorporated jujube dates.  In short: onion, carrot, celery, and jujubes sauteed until soft, add garlic,  added wine and chicken stock and brought to a boil, added meat, let marinate overnight in refrigerator, put in slow cooker with tomatoes, balsamic, thyme, and bay leaf, and cooked on low for 6 hours.  Did not brown meat first. Did not marinate with tomatoes/balsamic because it seemed like it would be too acidic. Jujubes/dates certainly aren’t necessary, but a good way to use them if they are around.  Very flavorful and tender.  Would be really good with purreed parsnips.
