# Roast Goose

`Christmas`

Mostly George Pauls, but refered to Joy and James. Latter is closer to correct about temp/time.

**Suggestions for next time:**

Check goose after 30 min, breasts might already be done.

Season day of

Try 325F instead of 350. 

**Recipe:**

Preheat oven to 450F.

Clean out goose \(neck, heart etc\). Cut the skin flaps around the opening to make the opening clear \(save the bits that have good bits of fat\). Pull chunks of fat out of cavity. Remove wing tips \(only one joint remaining\). 

Put all the fat and skin with fat into empty sauce pan with water and heat to get the fat to turn liquid, when the fat is out of the skin and bits, remove the skin etc and discard.

Prick the skin all over with a sharp knife, especially any areas that have large amounts of fat.

Salt the cavity. Rub half lemon throughout cavity. Add whole potato to cavity.  Rub skin with salt and pepper. 

Place goose on rack in roasting I pan and stick in oven. Lower temp to 350F. Start boiling kettle of water.

Occasionally \(every 15 min until breast is removed, then every 20\-30min\) open oven and baste the goose with water from kettle. Make sure fat isn’t overflowing and collect as necessary. 

After 30 min start checking breast temp. Target temp is 130\-135. Once it reaches this, remove goose, cut off breasts and tent them; return goose to oven.

Continue roasting until drumbsticks are 165 \(they will still be fine up to 175\).

Remove and tent carcass. Sear skin side of breasts in goose fat; 2\-3 minutes. Carve drumbsticks and wings and serve.
