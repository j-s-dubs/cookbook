# Bolognese

`pasta` `sauce` `main` `spaghetti` `bolognese`

2 tbsp olive oil

1 yellow onion finely chopped

1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped

1 stalk celery, finely chopped

12 oz ground beef

1 cup red wine

1 cup milk

14 oz tomatoes \(whole tomatoes, chopped up\)

Put a medium\-size, heavy\-bottomed pot over medium heat with the olive oil. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and saute until just beginning to brown, ~7\-10 min.  Turn the heat to high and add the ground beef and stir to break up the meat. Let the beef brown nicely. Add the wine and turn the heat down to medium – it should be somewhere between a simmer and a boil.  Stil every few minutes to make sure the sauce doesn’t stick to the bottom.  Let the wine reduce by half.  Add the milk and reduce again. Chop the canned tomatoes roughly and add with the tomato juices to the pot.  Season with salt/pepper/nutmeg, basil if possible.  Think about trying bay leaf.  Top with parm\!
