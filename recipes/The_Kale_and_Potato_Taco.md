 The Kale and Potato Taco is our newest addition to the menu at Brooklyn Taco.  This taco consists of Kale, Potato, poblano pepper, corn, cheese, crema and hot sauce.  I am particularly passionate about the Kale and Potato taco because it is unpretentious and yet, beautifully crafted. The finished product is balanced by salty, crispy potatoes, smoky peppers, sweet sauteed corn, nutty sauteed kale, spicy hot sauce and all brought together by Mexican crema and cheese. This taco is an example of why Mexican food is so approachable and satisfying.  Very few cuisines can take four or five ingredients and turn them into a dish that everyone can appreciate. Mexican food is often the hardest to master because one has to create bold flavors with a few simple ingredients. In this recipe, potatoes, poblanos and corn are ubiquitous ingredients in the Mexican pantry. I added Kale, a personal favorite, to the recipe and it sings sweet melodies to the taste buds. More importantly, this taco is a healthy alternative to the abundance of greasy meat\-lovers tacos that can be found on street corners across the country and throughout Mexico.

 
 ### Ingredients

#### For the filling: 

- 2 Red potatoes
- 1 Poblano pepper
- 1 Ear of corn
- 3 cup kale leaves \(rough chop\)
- Salt for potatoes and salt to season the final product
- Canola or corn oil \(not olive oil\)
- 2 Tortillas per taco

#### For toppings:

- Lime \(quartered\)
- Mexican Crema or sour cream \(drizzling on top of each taco\)
- Cotija cheese or parmesan cheese \(sprinkling on top of each taco\)
- Hot Sauce \- preferably Habanero.

 ### Preparation

#### Note: 

- \*Mexican ingredients can often be found in the Latin American section of your supermarket.\*

#### Step 1: 

- Dice potatoes \(smaller dices cook faster\) and cook in water with 1 teaspoon of salt until they are soft.

#### Step 2: 

- Cut the stem of the poblano pepper and remove the seeds. Roast the poblano pepper in an oven at its highest temperature \(500\+ degrees\) for 8 minutes, then flip the pepper and cook another 8 minutes. The skin should turn black and start to bubble. Burning the pepper's skin allows you to remove it easily. Finally, chop the pepper. 

#### Step 3: 

- Cut the corn off of the cob.

#### Step 4: 

- Mix the cooked potatoes with the roasted chopped poblanos and the raw corn.

#### Step 5: 

- Coat the bottom of a saute pan \(preferably cast\-iron\) with oil, set to high heat. 

#### Step 6: 

- Add the kale, cook for 30 seconds, then add the potato mix. The kale should burn slightly, which is the key to this dish because it gives it a smokey flavor. The potatoes will also brown due to the high heat. 

#### Step 7: 

- Season with salt and stir for 2 minutes.

#### Step 8: 

- Stack two tortillas together, drizzle with oil, and cook on a hot, flat surface \(griddle or pan\) for 30 seconds a side. The tortillas should get charred slightly, but should remain soft and moist. 

#### Step 9: 

- Scoop the cooked Kale mix into the taco, sprinkle with cheese, crema and hot sauce. Finish with a squeeze of lime.
