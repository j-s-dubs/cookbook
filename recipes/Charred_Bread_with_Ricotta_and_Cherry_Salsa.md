### Ingredients

8 servings
- 3 spring onions, preferably red, white/red and green parts separated, thinly sliced on a steep diagonal
- 5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 12 ounces fresh cherries \(about 2¼ cups\), pitted, cut into ⅓\-inch\-thick slivers
- ½ cup olive oil, plus more for brushing
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 1 baguette, sliced in half lengthwise
- 12 ounces whole\-milk fresh ricotta
- Flaky sea salt

### Preparation

Toss white/red parts of spring onions and lemon juice in a medium bowl to coat and let sit 10 minutes.

Add spring onion greens, cherries, and ½ cup oil to bowl and toss gently again to incorporate; season cherry salsa with kosher salt and pepper.

Prepare a grill for medium\-low heat. Brush cut sides of baguette with oil. Grill, cut sides down, until bread is toasted and golden brown, about 3 minutes.

Let toasts cool for a minute, then spread generous amounts of ricotta over both pieces. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt. Cut each half on a diagonal into 6 pieces. Arrange on a platter and, using a slotted spoon, top with cherry salsa.

**Do Ahead:** Cherry salsa can be made 6 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
