Have used with traditional and romesco cauliflower. Could probably use with broccoli as well.  Full amount of speck is too much, usually use ~1/8\-¼ lbs.

400g dried spaghetti

½ head of cauliflower, cut into small florets

30g butteru

2 Tbl of olive oil

250g speck, rind removed and cut into batons

4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped \(depends on your garlic tolerance level\)

1 small red chilli, deseeded finely chopped

¼ cup of white wine

Zest of one lemon

1 Tbl lemon juice

Flat\-leaf parsley

Parmesan

Cook pasta in plenty of boiling salted water and drain, reserving about ¼ cup of the pasta water. Add a splash of olive oil to the pasta and toss to coat to prevent from sticking together while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

In a large pan, melt the butter over medium\-high heat until foamy then throw in the cauliflower florets. Season with a little sea salt and sauté until cauliflower is cooked and toasty brown and caramelised \(about 10 minutes\). Remove the cauliflower and set aside.

Heat the oil in the same pan over medium heat then fry the speck until browned. Throw in the garlic and chilli and cook until the garlic is lightly browned.

Deglaze pan with the wine and cook until wine is mostly reduced then add the zest, lemon juice and cooked cauliflower.

Add in the cooked pasta and toss well to coat in the sauce adding the reserved pasta water bit by bit for lubrication if you need it. Season to taste with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper and remove from heat.

Roughly chop up as much parsley as you like then toss through the pasta. Grate some parmesan over, put your feet up then greedily tuck in \(directly from the pan if you feel so inclined\).
