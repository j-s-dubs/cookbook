`spring` `side` `asparagus` `mustard`

## Toasted seeds add crunchy texture to this flavorful side dish. Dressing them with a little olive oil and seasoning with salt and pepper makes it that much better.

### Ingredients

4 Servings
- 2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds \(pepitas\)
- 1 tablespoon sunflower seeds
- 1 teaspoon plus 1/4 tablespoon olive oil
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- 2 bunches asparagus, trimmed
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 ounce Parmesan, shaved

### Preparation

Preheat oven to 450°. Toast pumpkin and sunflower seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 4 minutes; let cool, then coarsely chop. Toss seeds with 1 tsp. oil in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, toss asparagus with 3 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing once, until crisp\-tender, 8–10 minutes.

Whisk vinegar, mustard, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper.

Serve asparagus drizzled with mustard vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan and toasted seed.
