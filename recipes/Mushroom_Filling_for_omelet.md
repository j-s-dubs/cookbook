      # Mushroom Filling

   ## Why This Recipe Works

 While developing our recipe for fluffy omelet, we realized that we had to rework traditional omelet fillings. We went with intensely flavored but lightweight ingredients that would not impede the omelet’s rise. A touch of Parmesan brought savory depth and also helped hold the filling in place.
