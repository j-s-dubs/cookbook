1/3 cup rice syrup

 1/3 cup packed \(2 1/3 ounces\) light brown sugar

 4 teaspoons vanilla extract

 ½ teaspoon salt

 ½ cup vegetable oil

 5 cups old\-fashioned rolled oats

 1 cup \(5 ounces\) raw almonds, chopped coarse

1 tbs chia seeds 

Adjust oven rack to upper\-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

Whisk rice syrup, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt in large bowl. Whisk in oil. Fold in oats and almonds and chia seeds until thoroughly coated.

Transfer oat mixture to prepared baking sheet and spread across sheet into thin, even layer \(about 3/8 inch thick\). Using stiff metal spatula, compress oat mixture until very compact. Bake until lightly browned, 30 minutes, rotating pan once halfway through baking. Remove granola from oven and cool on wire rack to room temperature, about 1 hour. Break cooled granola into pieces of desired size. Stir in dried fruit. \(Granola can be stored in airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\)
