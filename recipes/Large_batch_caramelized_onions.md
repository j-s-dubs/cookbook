15 min prep, ~3.5 hours cooking

Sweet onions, such as Vidalia or Walla Walla, will make this recipe overly sweet. Be patient when caramelizing the onions in step 2; the entire process takes 45 to 60 minutes. 

INGREDIENTS

- 3 tablespoons [unsalted butter](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americastestkitchen.com%2Ftaste_tests%2F548-unsalted-butter&t=MzU0YTg0MDNjMzZhNDEzMTNhYWNkMGRjMjJiZmU4MWVmNWY0MmNjNCxyZG9DeUl6cw%3D%3D&b=t%3AzZ3NOPhvh7uRX6k2fs1rbg&p=http%3A%2F%2Fhashtagrecipes.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F138955404002%2Flarge-batch-caramelized-onions&m=0), cut into 3 pieces
- 6 large yellow onions \(about 4 pounds\), halved and cut pole to pole into ¼\-inch\-thick slices \(see illustration below\)
- Table salt
- 2 cups water, plus extra for deglazing
- 1/2cup dry sherry

1. Adjust oven rack to lower\-middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Generously spray inside of heavy\-bottomed large \(at least 7\-quart\) Dutch oven with nonstick cooking spray. Place butter in pot and add onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, covered, 1 hour \(onions will be moist and slightly reduced in volume\). Remove pot from oven and stir onions, scraping bottom and sides of pot. Return pot to oven with lid slightly ajar and continue to cook until onions are very soft and golden brown, 1 ½ to 1 ¾ hours longer, stirring onions and scraping bottom and sides of pot after 1 hour.

2. Carefully remove pot from oven and place over medium\-high heat. Using oven mitts to handle pot, cook onions, stirring frequently and scraping bottom and sides of pot, until liquid evaporates and onions brown, 15 to 20 minutes, reducing heat to medium if onions are browning too quickly. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until pot bottom is coated with dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary. \(Scrape any fond that collects on spoon back into onions.\) Stir in ¼ cup water, scraping pot bottom to loosen crust, and cook until water evaporates and pot bottom has formed another dark crust, 6 to 8 minutes. Repeat process of deglazing 2 or 3 more times, until onions are very dark brown. Stir in sherry and cook, stirring frequently, until sherry evaporates, about 5 minutes.
