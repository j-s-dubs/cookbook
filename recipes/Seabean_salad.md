# Seabean salad

`seabeans` `salad`

Serves 4.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 1 minute

- 1 pound sea beans
- 1 large garlic clove, minced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil \(use high quality oil here\)
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup crumbled feta 
- Lemon or lime juice to taste
- \(avocado, citrus fruits would be good\)

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the sea beans for 1 minute. Transfer them to a bowl of ice water to cool. Let them rest a few minutes. Lay out a tea towel or other cloth towel. Pick through the sea beans to remove any stray bits of seaweed, and to remove any discolored bits or woody bottoms. Use only the top 2\-5 inches of the plant. Lay the cleaned sea beans on the towel to dry.
2. Pat the sea beans dry and toss with everything but the lemon juice. Add lemon juice until the salad is as tangy as you like it. Serve cold or at room temperature. This will keep in the fridge for a couple days.
