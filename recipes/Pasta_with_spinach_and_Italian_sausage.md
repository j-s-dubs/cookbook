`spinach` `pasta` `sausage`

2 tablespoons olive oil

8 oz Italian sausage \(sweet or sweet/hot mix\)

3 garlic cloves, minced

1/4 teaspoon anchovy paste

1 teaspoon all\-purpose flour

1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

3/4 cup chicken broth

1 bunch spinach or other greens \(broccoli rabe, etc\)

6 oz pasta \(used fettuccini, but could use anything\!\)

1/2 cup grated parmesan

1\) Heat oil in 12\-inch cast iron over medium\-high heat until shimmering.  Add sausage and cook, breaking up mean with wooden spoon, until brown and crisp, 5\-7 min.  Stir in garlic, anchovy, flour, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Site in broth, scraping up any browned bits.  Bring to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce is slightly thickened, 1\-2 min.  Remove from heat and keep warm.

2\) Meanwhile bring 4 quarts of liberally salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add pasta and cook, stirring often, until al dente.  Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water.

3\) Add spinach to boiling water and pasta and cook for 1 minute, then drain pasta and spinach.  Add pasta and spinach to simmering sausage gravy and then add parmesan.  Allow flavors to meld for 2\-3 min. Season with salt and pepper to taste, serve with extra parmesan.
