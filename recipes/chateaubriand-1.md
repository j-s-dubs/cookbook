      # Classic Roast Beef Tenderloin

   ## Why This Recipe Works

 When devising a no\-fuss recipe for perfectly cooked roast beef tenderloin, we chose to work with Chateaubriand, the smaller center\-cut roast. We reversed the usual cooking process for our tenderloin recipe, roasting first and then searing, to eliminate the ring of overdone meat just below the crust and give the roast a ruby coloring from edge to edge. Salting the meat and rubbing it with softened butter helped it hold on to its juices and gave it richness.

   ## Instructions

 Serves 4 to 6 
   If using table salt, reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon. Ask your butcher to prepare a trimmed, center\-cut Châteaubriand from the whole tenderloin, as this cut is not usually available without special ordering. If you are cooking for a crowd, this recipe can be doubled to make two roasts. Sear the roasts one after the other, wiping out the pan and adding new oil after searing the first roast. Both pieces of meat can be roasted on the same rack.

 
 1. Using 12\-inch lengths of twine, tie roast crosswise at 1 1/2\-inch intervals. Sprinkle roast evenly with salt, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.

 2. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Sprinkle roast evenly with pepper and spread unsalted butter evenly over surface. Transfer roast to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Roast until instant\-read thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 125 degrees for medium\-rare, 40 to 55 minutes, or 135 degrees for medium, 55 to 70 minutes, flipping roast halfway through cooking. 

 3. Heat oil in 12\-inch heavy\-bottomed skillet over medium\-high heat until just smoking. Place roast in skillet and sear until well browned on four sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side \(total of 4 to 8 minutes\). Transfer roast to carving board and spread 2 tablespoons flavored butter evenly over top of roast; let rest 15 minutes. Remove twine and cut meat crosswise into ½\-inch\-thick slices. Serve, passing remaining flavored butter separately.

 ### Tenderloin Troubles

 
   ![7301_sil-roastbeefcrust-007-htc.webp](image/7301_sil-roastbeefcrust-007-htc.webp)

 
  **CRUSTY BUT OVERCOOKED**

 Tenderloin with a good flavorful crust is often marred by a band of gray, overcooked meat near the edge.

 
 
   ![7302_sil-roastbeefcrust-008-htc.webp](image/7302_sil-roastbeefcrust-008-htc.webp)

 
  **EVENLY COOKED BUT NO CRUST**

 Tenderloin that is rosy from edge to edge typically lacks a good crust and meaty flavor.

 
 
  ## Technique

 ### Locating the Chateaubriand

 
   ![7303_sil-tenderloin-whole-1-htc.webp](image/7303_sil-tenderloin-whole-1-htc.webp)

 
  The center\-cut tenderloin, or Châteaubriand, comes from the middle of the whole tenderloin. The meat sits beneath the spine of the cow and gets no exercise at all, making it exceptionally tender. Furthermore, its cylindrical shape is an advantage for even cooking.

 ### A Better Way to Roast Beef Tenderloin

 
   ![7304_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-1-of-5-htc.jpg](image/7304_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-1-of-5-htc.jpg)

 
  **1. SALT** meat and let stand 1 hour to intensify flavor.

 
 
   ![7305_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-2-of-5-htc.jpg](image/7305_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-2-of-5-htc.jpg)

 
  **2. RUB** roast with small amount of softened butter to further boost flavor.

 
 
   ![7306_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-3-of-5-htc.webp](image/7306_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-3-of-5-htc.webp)

 
  **3. ROAST ON LOW** to ensure evenly cooked meat throughout.

 
 
   ![7307_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-4-of-5-htc.webp](image/7307_stp-roastbeeftenderloin-4-of-5-htc.webp)

 
  **4. SEAR ON STOVETOP** after roasting to create well\-caramelized crust with deep meaty flavor.

  **5. TOP WITH HERB BUTTER** before meat rests to bring extra layer of bright, rich flavor.
