# spicy lamb meatballs

`lamb` `meatballs` `spice and hutch`

- 2 lbs ground lamb
- 2 eggs
- 6 tbs bread crumbs
- 1 cup minced yellow or white onion
- 1 tbsp minced shallots
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp spicy paprika
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp rosemary
- 2 pinches turmeric
- 1 28 ounce can tomato puree
- 1 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- salt and freshly\-ground black pepper

1. Sautee the onions and shallot. Place the lamb in a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs, half of the spices and herbs, and half of the onion, shallots, and garlic. Season generously with salt and pepper. Mix the meat with your hands until the ingredients are evenly incorporated into the meat.
2. Adjust a oven rack to the upper part of the oven and turn on the broiler. Apply a light coat of olive oil to a large roasting pan, then shape the meat into golf ball\-sized portions and place the meatballs in the roasting pan about one inch apart from each other.
3. Broil for 5\-8 minutes, turning the meatballs halfway through cooking to ensure the tops and bottoms are evenly browned. Set aside, and set the oven at 400°.
4. Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or heavy\-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, about 3\-5 minutes, then add the shallots and garlic and cook for a minute or two longer. Pour in the tomato puree and add the remaining spices and herbs, and the lemon juice or vinegar and the bay leaf.
5. In a small mason jar, combine the cornstarch with 1 tsp cold water and shake vigorously until evenly combined, then add it to the tomato mixture. This is called a slurry, and it acts as a thickening agent for the sauce. 
6. Stir the sauce with a wooden spoon to blend together the ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and allow the mixture to gently simmer for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure the mixture doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pan.
7. Add the meatballs to the tomato mixture and toss until evenly coated. Cover saucepan, place it in the oven, and cook for 13\-15 minutes. To check for doneness, remove one meatball and slice it in half \- it's fine if they're slightly pink in the center, but if you prefer them medium\-well, then cook the meatballs for several minutes longer. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Garnish and enjoy\!
